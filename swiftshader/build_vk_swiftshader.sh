# Call this script **from the project root** to build SwiftShader's Vulkan ICD:
#   $ bash build_tools/third_party/swiftshader/build_vk_swiftshader.sh
#
# Note that you will need a working CMake installation for this script to
# succeed. On Windows, Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.
#
# Afterwards, set the VK_ICD_FILENAMES environment variable to the absolute
# path of the corresponding vk_swiftshader_icd.json manifest file so the Vulkan
# loader on your system loads it, for example:
#   Windows
#   $ set VK_ICD_FILENAMES=C:\dev\iree\build-swiftshader\Release\vk_swiftshader_icd_windows.json
#
#   Linux
#   $ VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/dev/iree/build-swiftshader/Linux/vk_swiftshader_icd.json
#
# See https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.1.70.1/windows/loader_and_layer_interface.html
# for further details about the Vulkan loader and ICDs.

# Check that we're in the project root so our relative paths work as expected.
